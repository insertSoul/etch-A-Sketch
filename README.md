# etch-A-Sketch
A grid based drawing program to test DOM method learning

Aims to have a user input for selecting grid size
When hoovered over the area it should draw in black

Additional goals
Random colors or user selectable colors

Main goal has been completed, and I have definitely become more comfortable with maniplulating the DOM with javascript.
Additional functions have been built in to make random girds, grids with unequal cells and the ability to remove the outline of the grid if required. 

If i was to return to this project i would be more carful in naming variables as most ended up with grid in there name, using cell to differentiate would have made things a lot clearer
